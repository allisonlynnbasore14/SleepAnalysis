# SleepAnalysis
We built a prototype for a sleep analysis app. This was designed for caregivers to make sure their caretakers are in bed.

To run our the program, download all the files into a single folder. Run the file 'SleepAnalysisFinalScript.m.'

Change the input data with your own accelerometer data in a csv file. The output will be an array of 1, and 0. If there are any 1's in the array, then the user has walking during the taking of the data.
